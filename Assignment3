Explain Hive Architecture & Components

Hive is an SQL-like service built on Hadoop MapReduce (latest update is built on Spark) which provides data summary,
query and analysis. It's architecture includes Metastore, Driver, several interfaces/connections.

Hive Queries are made via 3 main ways.

-Command Line Interface (CLI) is implemented via a command prompt.
-Hive Web Interface (HWI) is implemented via an online GUI as an alternative to using CLI.
-HiveServer2 (Thrift Server is the core of HS2) is an accumulation of different services that provide a flexibility to work with JDBC
and ODBC compliant Business Intelligence tools (clients).

Driver takes Hive queries and converts them into mapreduce jobs which are pushed to Resource Manager for processing.

Metastore (HCatalog) contains the metadata of objects created using Hive, and can be configured using JPOX ORM solution on any
compliant database server. It also acts as a schema repository accessible by other tools in the Hadoop ecosystem.
